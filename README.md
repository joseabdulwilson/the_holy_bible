- Sir?
- Now what Gabriel...
- I am wondering whether this isn't too much information for Humans to take in.
- For fucks sake Gabriel CAN YOU STOP QUESTIONING AND DOUBTING MY DECISIONS?
- 
- How many texts have you descended onto them Garbiel ? HOW MANY?
- Huh... quite a few Sir.
- YES, AND WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED IN THE PROCESS?
- Huh... That we... need to be precise Sir, otherwise they misinterpret the information, change it arround and end up killing and exploiting each other in your name.
- EXACTLY, THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO KEEP IT FACTUALLY PRECISE.

- Just... just add a tutorial on how to use the book Gaberil alright? CLEARLY this stuff isn't made to be read as a normal book, it is A HOLY BOOK: It is a resource they should open with a light weight PDF viewer in one tab of their tiling window manager and use for reference whenever they feel their faith failing.
- But how will they navigate all the pages Sir? How will they...
- Can you stop making reference to the number pages GABRIEL? All good PDF viewers have shortcuts to toggle the document's index on and off as a means to navigate the document... 
- Should they feel the need to quote your HOLY WORD how shall they proceed?
- I don't know... They could include the name of the book, the chapter and the verse.... BUT NEVER A PAGE NUMBER. 
- Should Chapter and verse be separated by a colon Sir? like "UNIX_Utilities Help:MAN" or "C Structures: "
- Yes, I like colons, especially the lower section of the colon, the one that gets close to the black hole, I ... I like black holes.
